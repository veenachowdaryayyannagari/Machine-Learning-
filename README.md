End-to-end data science project applying ETL, preprocessing, and machine learning with scikit-learn on Titanic, Iris, and Boston Housing datasets. Uses NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization with classification and regression models.
ETL and Machine Learning on Titanic, Iris, and Boston Housing Datasets

This project demonstrates a complete data science workflow in Python by applying ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, machine learning algorithms from scikit-learn, and data visualization with Matplotlib. The goal is to showcase data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation on three well-known benchmark datasets.

📊 Datasets

Titanic Survival Dataset – Predicting passenger survival (classification).

Iris Flower Dataset – Predicting flower species (classification).

Boston Housing Dataset – Predicting house prices (regression).

🛠️ Tools and Libraries

NumPy – for numerical computations and array operations.

Pandas – for structured data manipulation, cleaning, and feature engineering.

Scikit-learn – for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Matplotlib – for data visualization and performance plotting.

🤖 Machine Learning Models

Classification: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM).

Regression: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression.

🔎 Key Features

ETL Pipeline: Datasets are extracted, cleaned (handling missing values, categorical encoding), transformed (scaling and normalization), and prepared for modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps provide insights into feature distributions and relationships.

Model Training & Testing: Each dataset is split into training and testing sets. Models are trained, tuned, and evaluated using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision/recall, mean squared error).

Visualization of Results: Feature importance, decision boundaries, and error analysis are presented using plots for better interpretability.

🎯 Project Highlights

Demonstrates integration of ETL, preprocessing, machine learning, and visualization into a unified workflow.

Provides side-by-side comparison of different algorithms on the same datasets.

Implements both classification and regression tasks with interpretable results.

This repository is intended as a learning and demonstration project for applying machine learning techniques on classical datasets using Python’s scientific ecosystem.

This version is ~340 words and GitHub-ready.

Want me to also draft a one-liner tagline (like "End-to-end ML pipeline with ETL, scikit-learn, and visualization on benchmark datasets") for the top of your README?
